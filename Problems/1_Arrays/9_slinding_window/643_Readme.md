## 1. Problem Understanding
Problem Statement: You are given an integer array nums consisting of n elements and an integer k. You need to find the contiguous subarray of length k that has the maximum average and return that maximum average.

### Inputs and Outputs:

- Input:
  - nums: A list of integers (length n).
  - k: An integer representing the length of the subarray.
- Output:
  - A float value representing the maximum average of any contiguous subarray of length k.

### Constraints:

- The length of the subarray k is positive and k <= n.
- The elements in nums can be both positive and negative integers.

### Example:

- Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
- Output: 12.75
- Explanation: The subarray [12,-5,-6,50] has the maximum average of 12.75.
## 2. Initial Thoughts and Intuition

### First Things to Consider:

- The problem requires finding the maximum average of a contiguous subarray of fixed length k.
- A subarray is a consecutive portion of an array, so sliding window techniques might be effective here.
- Given that the subarray length is fixed, the problem reduces to finding the maximum sum of any subarray of length k, as maximizing the sum will maximize the average.

### Obvious or Intuitive Solutions:

An intuitive approach might involve calculating the sum of every subarray of length k and then determining which one is the largest. This can be done with a brute-force approach.
Simplifying the Problem:

Visualizing the problem as a sliding window: Start by calculating the sum of the first k elements. Then, slide the window one element at a time, adding the next element and subtracting the element that is left out of the window. This way, you can efficiently calculate the sum of each subarray of length k.
## 3. Core Concepts and Prerequisites
- Key Concepts:

- **Arrays:** Understanding basic array operations.
- Sliding Window Technique: A common approach for solving problems involving subarrays or substrings of fixed length.
- Optimization with Fixed Window Size: Instead of recalculating the sum for every subarray, you update the sum by subtracting the element that is leaving the window and adding the element that is entering the window.
## 4. Brute Force Approach
- Brute Force Solution:

- Logic:
  - Calculate the sum for each possible subarray of length k using a nested loop.
  - Track the maximum sum encountered and compute the corresponding average.
    
    ```python
        def findMaxAverage(nums, k):
            max_sum = float('-inf')
            
            for i in range(len(nums) - k + 1):
                current_sum = sum(nums[i:i+k])
                max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
                
            return max_sum / k

- **Time and Space Complexity:**

- Time Complexity: O(n*k), where n is the length of nums. The outer loop runs n-k+1 times, and the inner sum calculation takes O(k) time.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a few extra variables.

### Limitations:

- This approach is inefficient for large arrays since it involves recalculating the sum for overlapping subarrays multiple times.
## 5. Optimized Solution
- Optimizing the Brute Force Approach:

- Sliding Window Technique:
  - Start by calculating the sum of the first k elements (i.e., the first subarray).
  - Then, slide the window by one element at a time, subtracting the element that’s leaving the window and adding the new element that’s entering the window.
  - This reduces the time complexity significantly.


        def findMaxAverage(nums, k):
            current_sum = sum(nums[:k])
            max_sum = current_sum
            
            for i in range(k, len(nums)):
                current_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
                max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
                
            return max_sum / k
Time and Space Complexity:

Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of nums. The sum of the first k elements is calculated once, and then each subsequent sum is updated in O(1) time.
Space Complexity: O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.
Comparison of Optimization Strategies:

The sliding window approach is much more efficient than recalculating sums for overlapping subarrays, making it suitable for large input sizes.

## 6. Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough

def findMaxAverage(nums, k):
    current_sum = sum(nums[:k])  # Calculate the sum of the first k elements.
    max_sum = current_sum        # Initialize max_sum with current_sum.
    
    for i in range(k, len(nums)):
        current_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]  # Update the sum for the current window.
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)   # Update max_sum if current_sum is larger.
        
    return max_sum / k  # Return the maximum average.

Line 2: Calculate the sum of the first k elements, which is our starting window.
Line 3: Initialize max_sum with current_sum since it’s the first subarray we’ve checked.
Line 5: For each element from k to the end of the array, update current_sum by adding the next element and subtracting the element that’s left out.
Line 6: Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.
Line 8: Finally, return the maximum sum divided by k, which gives the maximum average.
