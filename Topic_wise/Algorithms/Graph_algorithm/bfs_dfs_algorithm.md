# Breadth-First Search (BFS) and 

- BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) are two fundamental graph traversal algorithms widely used in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). 
- They help in exploring nodes (or vertices) of a graph in different ways.

## **1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
### Definition:
- BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching graph data structures. 
- It **explores all the neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level** of neighbors. 
- BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph
